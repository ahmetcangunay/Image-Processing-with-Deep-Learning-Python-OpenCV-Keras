# Why Python?

- Python is one of the most used and preferred programming languages worldwide according to 2022 IEEE research.

- Python is the first choice of beginners thanks to its easy learnability.

- Since Python is open source, it is supported by the world's largest companies such as Facebook or Google.

- Python language comes to mind first when it comes to image processing, data science, machine learning or artificial intelligence. In this case, it causes Python to have a large audience around the world.

- Python is one of the easiest languages to learn.

- In terms of careers, Python is one of the languages with the most opportunities.   

# Why Image Processing?

- Image processing is a method used to perform some operations on an image, obtain an enhanced image or extract some useful information from it.

- It is important to process the images in a post-processing step to achieve an optimized workflow and avoid wasted time.

- Having knowledge of image processing will make a difference in business life.

- One of the two basic data in the world is the image. Image processing knowledge will take you one step ahead in many different areas.
